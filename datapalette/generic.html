								<h2>URL scraping (first tab)</h2>
								<hr>
								<h4>Methods</h4>
								<p style="width: 90%; text-align: justify;">
								There are three methods in DataPalette to collect URLs with. 
								The first method is through collecting all the links on a page, the second method is through collecting all the links on a page containing a specific substring,
								and the third method is through submitting a custom list of URLs.
								To use one of these methods simply select one of them in the first section of the URL scraper. 
								After doing this you can move on to the second step of submitting URL(s).	
								</p>
								<h4>Submitting URLs</h4>
								<p style="width: 90%; text-align: justify;">
								In the second box it's possible to submit URL(s) and an optional substring. What you have to fill in here depends on the method of choice.
								If you've selected <code>all links</code> then simply fill in the URL box and DataPalette will collect all the links on that page.
								If you've selected <code>all links containing a substring</code> then fill in the URL and the substring in the optional field.
								Finally, if you've selected <code>custom</code> then fill in all URLs you'd like to scrape (seperated with a space) in the URL box and leave the optional field empty.
								</p>
								<h4>Export</h4>
								<p style="width: 90%; text-align: justify;">
								After filling in the form click on <code>Export url file</code> and complete the file dialog.
								</p>
								<h4>Result and making URL files without using the scraper</h4>
								<p style="width: 90%; text-align: justify;">
								The URL file that is created is simply a txt file with a URL on every newline. Thus, it's also possible to create your own url file (through a script or download) in this format and use it in DataPalette.
								This product is meant to be felixible so compatibillity shouldn't be an issue.
								</p>
								<br>
								<h2>Content scraping (second tab)</h2>
								<hr>
								<h4>Open URL file</h4>
								<p style="width: 90%; text-align: justify;">
								By clicking on the button <code>Open url file</code> you can select the file you just made in the URL scraper.
								To reiterate, you can also select a file you didn't make through the URL scraper. 
								As long as it's a txt file that contains a URL file on every line.
								</p>
								<h4>Explore URL file</h4>
								<p style="width: 90%; text-align: justify;">
								After opening a URL file this section should show the meta properties that can be scraped through the dropdown menu.
								To start exploring simply select one of these items in the dropdown menu and view a sample in text or html with the button <code>see text only</code> or <code>see html-code</code> below.
								</p>
								<h4>Add items to scraper</h4>
								<p style="width: 90%; text-align: justify;">
								Next, adding items to the scraper. To do this, simply click the button <code>add item to scraper</code> when the sample in the exploration window fits your needs. 
								Please note that, only if an item is loaded in the exploration window it can be added to the scraper.
								</p>
								<h4>Export items to CSV</h4>
								<p style="width: 90%; text-align: justify;">
								After filling in the form click on <code>Export as CSV</code> to export your items to csv for every URL in the URL file.
								<b>Please keep in mind that this can take a while. So if it looks like the program is not responding it's best to wait.</b>
								Once the program is complete it will show a notice with the amount of succesfully exported rows.
								</p>
								<br>
								<h2>Other</h2>
								<hr>
								<h4>Tools</h4>
								<p style="width: 90%; text-align: justify;">
								In the menu bar on the top of the screen there are two different tools. The first tool is to see the selected items (that belong to the scraper)
								and the second tool is to see the URLs loaded by the URL file.
								</p>
								<h4>Development status</h4>
								<p style="width: 90%; text-align: justify;">
								Currently DataPalette is still in beta development status. This means that bugs occur from time to time <i>and</i> not all features are implemented yet.
								Thus, if you encounter any bugs or if you have any feedback feel free to share it with us! Please click <a href="mailto:tpakats@gmail.com">here</a> to do so.
